# Mars_WebScraping-HTML

# Overview of Project  
Create and Submit the following deliverables:

Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

# Purpose 
Use Juptyer Notebook and Webscraping to do a weather analysis and data exploration on Mars.

# Requirements
Juptyer Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib. 

# Data Analysis 
1. How many months exist on Mars?

12

2. How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
1977. 

5. What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
    Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
    Plot the results as a bar chart.
    
  Coldest: -83 degrees, in the third month. 
  Warmest: -68 degrees, in the eigth month.

4. Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:
    Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
    Plot the results as a bar chart.
    
    Lowest Atmospheric Pressure: 745, in the sixth month. 
    Highest Atmospheric Pressure: 913, in the ninth month.

5. About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:
    Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
    Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.

A year on Mars is approximately equivalent to 675 days on earth.
